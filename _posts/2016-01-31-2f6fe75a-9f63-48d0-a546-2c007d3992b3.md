I typically keep my daughter's photos and videos behind locked accounts, but I thought I'd give The Grid a swing at her and a friend playing in a sandbox last night. I also tried to take a few photos, but I could never get both of them to say "cheese" at the same time. It was like a verbal "cheese" ping pong game.
